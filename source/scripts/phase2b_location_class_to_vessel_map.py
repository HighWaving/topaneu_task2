"""Curated location(52) -> vessel-segment(36) mapping, by class semantics not voxel overlap.

Peer-review-driven: phase2's voxel-overlap purity (0.66 mean) measures the
wrong geometric quantity -- an aneurysm bulges OFF a vessel, so most of its
own voxels sit outside the vessel_masks segmentation by construction. The
correct question is attachment (nearest vessel segment), not overlap.

Every one of the 52 class NAMES already encodes its anatomical relationship
to vessel_mapping.json's 36 segments:

* SINGLE  (22 classes): named after exactly one vessel segment
  (e.g. "R-1.1 VA trunk" -> R-VA). A geometric method should identify this
  one segment.
* JUNCTION (20 classes): named as a junction between two segments
  (e.g. "R-1.3 VA-PICA junction" -> {R-VA, R-PICA}). A geometric method
  should find both segments represented near the lesion.
* POSITION (10 classes): share a vessel_masks segment with a sibling class,
  distinguished only by proximal/distal position along it (e.g. "R-4.2 A1"
  and "R-4.3 A2" are both on segment R-A1A2). Vessel-segment identity ALONE
  cannot disambiguate these -- they need an additional along-vessel-position
  feature, not attempted here. Flagged, not silently scored as solvable.

This is a judgement call on ambiguous cases (BA tip, C6-nonOA, C7-terminus,
etc.) -- documented inline. Not claimed to be the only reasonable reading;
built to be checked and adjusted, not accepted blind.
